The British is a fiercely loyal, loving cat and will attach herself to every one of her family members. While loving to play, she doesn't need hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will find someone and bring a toy to that person. The British also plays well by herself, and thus is a good companion for single people.        ",
